# MIT Open Source Competition Repository
The purpose of this repository is to provide all of the necessary research related to the paper entitled Judgement Under Uncertainty: An Empirical Evaluation of NHL Draft Picks. 
# Draft Trades Dataset
The Draft Trades Dataset was webscraped from ProSportsTransactions and includes 356 trades from 1980-2020 involving only draft picks. Each row of the csv file includes relevant information on the trade, including picks exchanged and picks received, as well as the year of each draft pick. The 356 draft trades can be separated into two groups: 191 involving picks from the current year, and 165 involving both current and future picks.
# Point Shares Dataset
The Point Shares of players from the 1980-2010 draft classes were then webscraped from hockey-reference.com. This dataset includes 7751 players: 4451 forwards, 2532 defensemen, and 768 goalies. Each row of the csv file includes the draft pick, the name of the player, position, Games Played, Point Shares, and Time on Ice. Drafted players whose information was not given on the hockey-reference.com website were referred to by the name of the player drafted before them whose information was known. However, these players position was assigned based on their designation when they were drafted.
